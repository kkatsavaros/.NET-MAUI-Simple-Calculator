.NET MAUI - Simple Calculator


That application is a simple .NET MAUI Calculator. 


For this application i use Styling tags with Resourse.Dictionary.

I have installed  PropertyChanged.Fody  NuGet package for implementaion of the INotifyProperyChanged interface.

Also I use the Dangl.Calculator NuGet Package to make all the calculations.
